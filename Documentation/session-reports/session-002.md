# Session Report - January 2, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on environment configuration, deployment improvements, and documentation updates. We successfully resolved Firebase configuration issues and enhanced the application's documentation to reflect current features and capabilities.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Implemented proper environment variable structure using `.env.staging`
- Fixed Firebase configuration loading in staging environment
- Resolved white screen issues caused by missing configuration
- Enhanced build process with proper mode flags

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated FAQ component with current features and workflows:
  - Enhanced gear management descriptions
  - Added timeline view functionality
  - Updated specification tracking details
  - Improved service history documentation
  - Enhanced security information
  - Updated organization and filtering capabilities

### 3. Deployment Process
- Fixed staging deployment workflow
- Implemented proper environment variable loading in builds
- Enhanced build configuration and scripts
- Successfully deployed and verified all changes

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Environment Structure
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...
```

### Build Process
- Using `build:staging` script for proper mode
- Environment variables correctly loaded during build
- Bundle size optimization noted for future work

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Environment Variable Loading
- **Issue**: Variables not loading in production build
- **Resolution**: Updated build configuration
- **Implementation**: Used correct mode flag in build script

### 2. Firebase Configuration
- **Issue**: White screen in deployment
- **Resolution**: Properly formatted environment variables
- **Implementation**: Created `.env.staging` with correct format

### 3. Build Warnings
- **Issue**: Large bundle size warning
- **Status**: Noted for optimization
- **Solution Plan**: Code splitting and dynamic imports

## Documentation Updates
1. Updated FAQ component
2. Verified all core documentation files:
   - Project Requirements Document (PRD)
   - App Flow Documentation
   - Frontend Guidelines
   - Backend Structure
   - Tech Stack Documentation
   - File Structure Documentation
   - README

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting
