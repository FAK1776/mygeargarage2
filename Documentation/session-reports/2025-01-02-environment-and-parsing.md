# Session Report - January 2, 2025
## Environment Configuration and Service History Improvements

### Session Overview
This session focused on resolving critical issues with environment configuration and service history parsing. The work was primarily centered around fixing staging environment issues and improving the reliability of the Gemini API integration.

### Key Achievements

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Fixed staging environment variable loading
   - Implemented proper build commands for staging
   - Verified environment configuration in production builds
   - Established correct deployment workflow

2. **Service History Parsing**
   - Enhanced Gemini API integration reliability
   - Fixed case sensitivity issues in response parsing
   - Improved date handling for relative dates
   - Added robust fallback mechanisms
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery

3. **Build Process**
   - Optimized staging deployment workflow
   - Improved build configuration
   - Enhanced environment variable handling
   - Streamlined deployment process

### Technical Details

1. **Environment Variable Loading**
   ```bash
   # Previous (incorrect) deployment command
   npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting:staging

   # Fixed deployment command
   npm run deploy:staging  # Uses build:staging internally
   ```

2. **Service History Parsing Improvements**
   - Updated Gemini prompt to specify lowercase field names
   - Added case-insensitive field matching in parsing logic
   - Enhanced date string handling for "today" and relative dates
   - Improved error recovery with fallback parsing

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Added staging-specific build command
   - Implemented proper environment variable loading
   - Enhanced build process reliability

### Issues Resolved

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Issue: Environment variables not loading in production
   - Resolution: Implemented proper staging build command
   - Validation: Verified through staging deployment

2. **Service History Parsing**
   - Issue: Case sensitivity causing parsing failures
   - Resolution: Added case-insensitive field matching
   - Validation: Successfully tested with various inputs

3. **API Integration**
   - Issue: API key service blocked errors
   - Resolution: Fixed environment configuration
   - Validation: Confirmed API functionality

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Address build size warnings
   - Implement code splitting
   - Create deployment documentation

2. **Short-term Tasks**
   - Enhance service history UI
   - Improve error messaging
   - Add validation feedback

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance features
   - Complete documentation

### Notes for Next Session

- Implement code splitting
- Update deployment documentation
- Consider UI/UX improvements for service history
- Plan error handling enhancements
