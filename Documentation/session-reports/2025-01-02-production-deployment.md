# Session Report: Production Deployment and API Integration
Date: January 2, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on deploying the application to production under the new domain axevault.com and resolving API integration issues across both staging and production environments.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Production Domain Setup
- Successfully configured axevault.com as the production domain
- Implemented proper Firebase hosting configuration
- Verified domain setup and DNS configuration
- Ensured proper routing and SSL configuration

### 2. Gemini API Integration
- Resolved API access issues across environments
- Configured proper domain restrictions for the API key
- Successfully tested gear parsing functionality in both environments
- Implemented proper error handling for API responses

### 3. Multi-Environment Deployment
- Successfully deployed to both staging (staging-my-gear-garage.web.app) and production (axevault.com)
- Verified build process for both environments
- Confirmed proper environment variable handling
- Established clear deployment workflow

## Technical Details

### API Configuration
- Added domain restrictions in Google Cloud Console
- Configured API key to allow requests from:
  - staging-my-gear-garage.web.app
  - axevault.com
- Verified proper API access and error handling

### Deployment Process
1. Staging Deployment
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```
2. Production Deployment
   ```bash
   npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting:production
   ```

### Error Resolution
1. API Access (403 Error)
   - Root Cause: Domain restrictions on API key
   - Solution: Added both domains to allowed list
   - Verification: Tested gear parser in both environments

## Current Status
- Production site (axevault.com) is fully functional
- Staging environment remains operational for testing
- All core features working in both environments
- API integration functioning properly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement proper error tracking
   - Monitor API usage and performance
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

2. Documentation Updates
   - Document deployment process
   - Create API configuration guide
   - Update troubleshooting documentation

3. Performance Optimization
   - Review and optimize API calls
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Enhance error handling and recovery

### Future Considerations
1. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Automate deployment process
   - Implement proper testing in pipeline
   - Add deployment safeguards

2. Security Enhancements
   - Regular security audits
   - API key rotation strategy
   - Enhanced error logging

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Set up performance metrics
   - Implement user analytics
   - Monitor API usage patterns

## Notes for Next Session
- Review API usage patterns and implement optimization if needed
- Consider implementing automated deployment process
- Review and enhance error handling strategies
- Consider implementing proper logging solution
